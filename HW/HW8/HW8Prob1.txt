HW 8 Problem 1:

I found it interesting that even though functional programming has been around for a long time, it only recently has gained popularity, especially in distributed systems. 
I also never knew that Twitter uses Scala pretty heavily. 
They also brought up that Facebook and AT&T use functional programming languages for their delivery and security networks. 
Additionally, I didn’t know that Python includes a lot of features of functional programming, since I’ve never used those aspects before. 
Also, I found it interesting that when describing functional programming, they simply state that data is immutable, meaning it never changes, 
and that the programs themselves are stateless, meaning it doesn’t depend on what happened earlier in the execution of the program. 
Furthermore, I’ve never heard about the reduce() function before, but it looks very useful in functional programming when adding up an array. 
I can also see the use in the map() function.
